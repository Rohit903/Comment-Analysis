0,I just got a pair of these in petite 28. and really like them. i am short though so even the petite length is too long for me- i wish it was the height of the cuff shorter than it is so i end up folding the cuff up. it still looks cute though. the stitching details are nice and quality seems good. hoping they hold up. the fabric seems durable if not a little too thick for hot summer weather but great for indoor a/c office temperatures. i am not going to buy another pair at full price but would c,,,0.402018,positive
3,"I love this tunic! it has an unusual neckline with decorative stitching and beautiful buttons,.i like the slight sheen of the fabric as well. wearing it makes me feel elegant without sacrificing comfort. i'm going to wear it for work with black leggings and on weekends with jeans; i suspect it will also be great to travel in. the only potential downsides might be the deep side slit and the fact that it has to be dry cleaned.",,,0.668183,positive
5,"First off - i love these jeans... they are the exact look i have been searching for, and the bands around the hem are what really sold me on this specific pair. the only problem - which i found with a previous purchase - is that they hit me at the ankle, rather than what is pictured. since i liked everything about these jeans, i decided to so with plan b and had them altered to be about an inch shorter. this involved cutting the hem at the top of the bands and reattaching... the stitching blends",,,0.444289,positive
14,This skirt is lovely and fits perfectly. the print on the front provides a great contrast to the back of the skirt and stands out. the material is thick enough to take you from fall to winter easily. and the fabric is structured enough to highlight all the right curves. a great purchase.,,,,
20,Ordered my regular size s early this week and was thrilled to receive them yesterday. they fit just as expected and are quite comfortable. i would definitely recommend them as a nice alternative to pajamas or even as a slip.,,,,
22,I loved the cut out features on the shoulders of this shirt. it has the palest tone as pictured and will be cute with jeans this summer and on vacation. i took one star away because the body is cut rather large. i tested the center back fit and that was fine. i wish the body was a little more narrow.,,,,
25,Absolutely wonderful! they fit like a dream. you could dress them up or down. i'll probably live in these jeans forever.,,,,
29,I have never tried this brand before and was pleasantly surprised at the fit! i especially like the button detail as it makes them a little more dressy and different. i plan to wear with a simple white tank and sandals. i will definitely look for this brand again!,,,,
36,I love pilcro's jeans. they fit adults without being mom jeans. the quality is great. the legging cut is simple with just the right amount of stretch. they're a tiny bit short but i like to show a little skin in booties.,,,,
49,These pants have a very odd design but they are so soft and so comfortable i could not resist. going on a trip to key west and thought they would be great for the plane ride. they fit true to size. could not pass up as they were on sale.,,,,
76,"This top looks much nicer on the model than in-person. i tried it on, it didn't look flattering and was shorter than i like. in the picture i really like the top with the design and frills on the side, gives the model a waist. in-person the design doesn't stand out much and the frills look wrinkled.it is also sweatshirt material and a tad stiff. i am sending it back. it just didn't look as flattering. also, it seemed more fitted at the top than bottom.",,,,
90,Very happy with this top! love the design--very different. also like that the front panel is different fabric. buttons also are a fun detail. great shirt to transition from summer to fall. i usually wear xs or s--ordered this in xs and perfect fit. going to be a favorite.,,,,
92,"I ran to the store to try to this on after seeing it online. i'm usually between a small and medium on tops depending on the shirt; the 6 fit true to size. everything about this shirt fit perfectly and it is beautifully designed, but it is just soooo sheer. i had a nude bra on and you could see every detail of it through both the front and back. i couldn't wear this comfortably without a cami. disappointing as i had the highest hopes for finding a crisp white shirt for the summer!",,,,
101,The shirt is a little roomy but so flattering. the design with little see through holes across the shirt are unusual and make it unique.,,,,
112,"The detail and overall quality of the fabric is incredible. i normally avoid swing dresses, but this is a flattering dress. i typically wear between sizes 2-6 (depending on designer) and a 6 fit me perfectly. i'm extremely happy that i purchased it and received compliments as soon as i wore it out. i'm also tall, so i have to be concerned with length of dresses and this falls perfectly right at the top of the knee.",,,,
0,"I noticed this vest hanging in my local store and tried it on on a whim because it felt so soft. i usually wear an xs or s in retailer's clothing so i tried on the xs/s and felt it was true to size - it's obviously large, but that's because that is the style! the shoulders fell perfectly. i was in love from the moment i put it on! while it's not my normal style, it was so soft and beautiful and it flowed perfectly, plus the extra fabric allowed for a bit of ""cozying up"" in colder weather by wrappi",,,,
1,"This dress is beautiful! it is a nice, heavy fabric with stretch and just fits perfectly.",,,,
5,"Totally love this shirt as a basic with fun details. super soft great quality fabric, and the cutouts add the perfect bit of interest. can see this accessorizing well and looking good with jeans or skirts. really happy with it. fits loose, but tts.",,,,

23,"I love the print and style of the skirt. it is very cute and feminine and can easily be worn into autumn. the downside is that the elastic waist is a little too loose and needs to be tighten. also, the is a lot of extra fabric in the skirt and makes it look so much larger than it is and it runs about 3 inches longer. for reference, i'm 5'5, 34 24 35 and the xs is loose in the waist. still, i really love the skirt and plan on keeping it and having it altered.",,,,
38,"I really love this shirt. the cutouts make it unique and the fabric is super soft for a chambray style. i thought the fit was perfect - i'm 5'5"", 120lbs and i ordered an xs. still enough room to be comfortable. super cute! glad i bought it.",,,,
28,"I have to disagree with some previous reviews -- i think the buttons on these ankle jeans really set them apart. they look absolutely adorable with booties, flats, wedges, heels, anything! and they're extremely comfortable and flattering, as most pilcros tend to be. i got my usual size 26 and the rise and fit is great. i think maybe they stretch out a bit; i've only worn them a couple times and by the end of the day the waist seems a little loose. but overall, great and a good price (at least co",,,,
39,"These jeans were a pleasant surprise. they are comfy, stretchy and fit right at the ankle. i have skinny legs and i love that these are a slim fit .i am normally a 27 waist but the 26 had a better fit. the dark demin and the gold buttons give it a dressy look. they also give my derriere a nice shape. i am 5?2?, 116 lbs and i have slim hips. to top it off, the jeans were an additonal 30% off the sale price!",,,,
63,"I bought this online with the intention of it being my graduation dress. i'm 5'2"", 115 pounds so i should've known better and gotten a ""petite"" style dress. however, i loved the modern look of this and since my boobs are a bit bigger (34d) i figured they would help fill it out. upon receiving the dress, i was first shocked that for the price, the construction was pretty poor quality: there were strings coming out of the straps and they looked unevenly sewn. when i put it on, it was clear that th",,,,
66,"The pattern and color of this top are beautiful. when i saw the pattern, i knew i had to have it. the fit is a bit strange, short (which is fine for me as i am petite) and boxy. i bought it on sale and think its good value for the price. its a good late summer/early fall piece.",,,,
87,"I bought this top during the extra 30% off sale, so the price was definitely worth it and i know i'll get a lot of wear out it. i bought the grey and the lace isn't too revealing, but just enough for me to want to wear a cami underneath, especially at work. i'm normally a small/4 in retailer brands, but i bought a xs and it fits great, so it does run a little large.",,,,
107,"I love this blouse. it is perfect for a curvy figure. i think it runs true to size. maybe size up if you have a larger chest. i love how it is so feminine yet structured. the fabric is lovely, soft and structured all at once. love the knot, i tried it with the stevie ankle jean and couldn't leave the store without it. it is pricey but sometimes its okay to pay $$$ for a perfect fit!",,,,

7211,"The fair-isle details are gorgeous and the wool is thick, but not itchy. the neckline is a perfect crew cut style- not too tight, but compliments the neck itself. the stitching has a lot of beautiful neutral colors so you can wear this with jeans, blue or gray cords, etc. so many options!!!",,,,
7698,"I love tunics and the colors of this one is what caught my eye. overall, the tunic is nice but i have to agree with another review that the stitching at the top of the slits is not good. i also agree that the slits are to high. they should have made them stop at a lower point. it gives an odd effect. the tunic looks good especially with tights. it is tts and i believe the top probably looks better on someone tall because the length of it is so long compared to other tunics.",,,,
